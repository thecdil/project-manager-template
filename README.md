# About the Project Management Kit

This site is a means for managing digital projects. The site uses a [Digital Project Services Level Agreement]({{'assets/UODSSServiceLevelAgreement2018.pdf' | relative_url}}) document created by [Kate Thornhill](https://library.uoregon.edu/users/kmthorn) and [Franny Gaede](https://www.mfgaede.com/) of the University of Oregon to enable a collaborative site that manages your project's initial and final service agreements, as well as the deadlines, milestones, meeting minutes and other resources related to your project. 

This site is currently under development and way way way difficult to use (I'm asssuming).
