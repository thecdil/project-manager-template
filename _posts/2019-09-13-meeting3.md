Devin presented his really bad first stab at a collectionbuilder.github.io page

Devin questioned whether we need to change the name? 

We looked at the calendar. 

Upcoming --> Code4Lib workshops; article

Month --> GlobalDH; Digital Initiatives; DH2020

Olivia --> working on Digital Home page
 -> workshop plans up; going to grab 10 collection csv

 Jylisa --> building cb-issues; documentation formats, code of conducts, etc. 

 Jylisa going to intro documentation to Michael and Chelsea this coming week


Next Steps: 

Sprint -- all the collections that we can
collectionbuilder.github.io

 - documentation pages
 - types comparisons
 - type pages
 - about page
 - Workshop + Presentation

- DeBrand CollectionBuilder --> new colors for sure. New look? back to label for front page
